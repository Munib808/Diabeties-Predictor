# üáµüá∞ Pakistan Diabetes Predictor

This project aims to **predict diabetes outcomes** among individuals in Pakistan based on medical, demographic, and lifestyle information. The model uses several machine learning algorithms to evaluate the likelihood of diabetes. An interactive **Streamlit web application** is also included for real-time prediction.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploration and visualization were performed using the following tools:

-  **Pie Charts** ‚Äì Distribution of categorical features (Distribution of Target)
-  **Barplots & Countplots** ‚Äì Categorical comparison with Outcome
-  **Histograms** ‚Äì Distribution of numeric variables like Age, BMI, B.S.R
-  **Boxplots** ‚Äì Detection of outliers
-  **Scatter Plots & Pairplots** ‚Äì Visualizing feature relationships
-  **Correlation Heatmap** ‚Äì To identify most predictive features

## Machine Learning Models Used

The following models were applied and evaluated:

- `LogisticRegression`
- `KNeighborsClassifier`
- `DecisionTreeClassifier`
- `RandomForestClassifier`
- `ExtraTreesClassifier`
- `AdaBoostClassifier` Final Model(100% Accuracy)
- `VotingClassifier` (Ensemble of top models)
- `StackingClassifier` (Combining base learners)

### Evaluation Metrics:
